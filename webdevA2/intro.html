    <h1><span class="highlight">New</span> to Formula 1?</h1> <!--Introduction-->
    <p>Ever want to know the <span class="highlight">ins</span> and outs of the sport?</p>
    <p>Don't worry, I've got you covered!</p>
    <p>Here are the 3 main sections of F1, being the practice session, the qualifying session, and last but not least, the main event, the race section!</p>
  </section>
  <div id="about">
    <h2><span class="highlight">Practice Sessions</span></h2>
    <p>Practice Sessions are all about getting the car ready for qualifying and the race! They last 60 mins each.</p>
    <p>Before the start of the 2021 Season, they used to last 90 minutes each.</p>
    <p>This means setup changes, low fuel runs, and in rare scenarios, if there is rain, rain setup testing!</p>
    <p>There are 3 practice sessions in a normal race weekend, however, during a <a class = "highlight" href="https://shorturl.at/ryz45" target ="_blank"> F1 Sprint</a>, there would only be 2 practise sessions, one before qualifying and one the day after qualifiying.</p>
    <div class='highlight-div'>
      <p class=highlight>Fun Fact:</p>
      <p>Before 2022, Practice Sessions in the <a class = "highlight" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monaco_Grand_Prix" target ="_blank"> Monaco Grand Prix</a> used to be held on Thursdays instead of the usual Fridays due to a public holiday celebrated by Monaco Citizens on Friday.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div id="about2">
    <h2><span class="highlight">Qualifying Sessions</span></h2>
    <p>Qualifying Sessions are all about getting the car to it's maximum potential!</p>
    <p>During Qualifying, Drivers will drive the F1 car to it's limits to set the fastest time of the session.</p>
    <p>There are 3 qualifiying sessions, Q1, which has 20 cars in, and lasts 20 minutes. The slowest 5 drivers of the session would get eliminated, while the rest move on to Q2.</p>
    <p>Q2 would have 15 cars in, and lasts 15 minutes. The slowest 5 drivers of the session would get eliminated, while the rest move on to Q3.</p>
    <p>Q3 would see 10 drivers compete for Pole Position, which would be the fastest time of the session. If a driver is on Pole Position, he starts in first place for the race, whereas the other drivers line up in the position they qualified in for the race.</p>
    <p>For Sprint Weekends, the driver who is on Pole Position starts first for the Sprint Qualifying, and not the race.</p>
    <div class='highlight-div'>
      <p class=highlight>Fun Fact:</p>
      <p>In 2016, the FIA decided to make a change to qualifying by eliminating the slowest car after seven minutes in Q1. This process of knocking out the driver that is at the bottom of the leaderboard carried on throughout the session, with the slowest driver eliminated every 90 seconds until the qualifying segment ended.</p>
      <p>This process would repeat for Q2 and Q3. However, after 2 races of this Qualifying format, the FIA reverted back to the old format as they felt that the new format was too confusing.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div id="about3">
    <h2><span class="highlight">Race Sessions</span></h2>
    <p>Race Sessions is where the main event starts!</p>
    <p>During Races, Drivers would have to driver a fixed amount of laps around the circuit depending how long it is, and whoever crosses the finish line first on the last lap wins the race!</p>
    <p>Championship Points are awarded during the race, from 25 points if u win the race, to 1 point if u finish 10th. If you get the fastest lap during a race and you finish in the top 10, you get a point too!</p>
    <p>A lot of drama, action, and intense battles happen during the race, so i would suggest u watch this segment the most!</p>
    <p>Drivers are required to pit once during the race, and they have to use 2 different tyre compounds during the race, which allows for strategic battles too!</p>
    <div class='highlight-div'>
      <p class=highlight>Fun Fact:</p>
      <p> In the past, points were only given to the top 8 instead of the top 10! First place would get 10 points, while 8th place would get only 1 point. This lead to more exciting championship battles!</p>
      <p><a class = "highlight" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhPw8gtfgv4&ab_channel=FORMULA1" target ="_blank"> Here </a> are the highlights of a race to help you understand more about the sport. Enjoy!</p>
